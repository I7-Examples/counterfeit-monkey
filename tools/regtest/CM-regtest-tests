Can you hear me? >>

Good, you're conscious. We're conscious. I've heard urban legends about synthesis going wrong, one half person getting lost.

Do you remember our name?
> andra
Exactly right. And I'm Alex, making us jointly Alexandra. As far as I can tell, the operation was a success. We're meant to be one person now, unrecognizable to anyone who knew us before.

Counterfeit Monkey
A Removal by Emily Short
/Release.*


Let's try to get a look around. I haven't been able to run our body without your help, but maybe now you're awake, it'll work better.

We are equipped with the following essentials: a backpack, a flash drive, a monocle, some plans, and your R-remover.

Everything we carry is in the backpack except the plans. The backpack is gaping wide open so everyone can see what's inside.

>wave l-remover at plans
We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an L-remover. There is a smell of anise, and the plans turn into some pans. A set of flat skillets in cast iron: extremely bulky and heavy.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

Mine: a little bit worn, but capacious. It doesn't have any identifying marks on it, and I thought a brand-new bag would look more suspicious. It's closed.

In the backpack are your L-remover, a cate, a lime, a wig, a flash drive, and a monocle.

I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

Back Alley
This isn't much, is it? Just the back sides of a couple of buildings, some peeling yellow paint, and not even much by way of windows to look in through. I think the place where we had the procedure done is just a block or two away, but I've already lost the door. I imagine they change it.

This alley runs north to the open street, towards the town square. That's the way we'll want to go first.

/We can see a backpack here. (There|In the backpack) are your L-remover, a cate, a lime, and a flash drive( in the backpack)?.

We can also see some dusty tomes, a bent twig, a broken clock, some members, an army, and some pans here. 

>look carefully
Back Alley
There is nothing here but the back sides of a couple of buildings, some peeling yellow paint; not even much by way of windows to look in through.

This alley runs north to the open street, towards the town square.

/We can see a backpack here. (There|In the backpack) are your L-remover, a cate, a lime, and a flash drive( in the backpack)?.

We can also see some dusty tomes, a bent twig, a broken clock, some members, an army, and some pans here. 

>x bent twig
Nine or ten inches long, very thin and somewhat flexible. There are no leaves left on it.

The monocle pings happily as we sight the bent twig with the crosshairs.

/(Something makes you think|You are reminded) of how we got here.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
>x broken clock
It appears to be one of those archetypal alarm clocks that crows at sunrise and generally makes a nuisance of itself. It shows the time to be about ten past nine.

It's stopped working sometime in the recent past, possibly thanks to its fall when we gelled it.

>wave t-remover at twig
We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to a T-remover. With a distinct whiff of the faintest whiff of dust, the bent twig turns into a Ben wig. It is a wig belonging to — at a guess — a Ben Franklin costume. A rubbery pate simulates baldness at the top of the head, while grey curls hang below. It would not, I fear, look remotely persuasive on our head.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the Ben wig is a faint, greenish image of a bent twig.

>wave l-remover at clock
We reset the device to l. The device buzzes, puzzled. It has tried to create a "broken cock": evidently "clock" is too tightly bound to its modifiers and can't be manipulated separately. This is a serious problem in my field of study, incidentally.

>wave m-remover at tomes
We reset the device to m. The device buzzes, puzzled. It has tried to create a "dusty toes": evidently "tomes" are too tightly bound to their modifiers and can't be manipulated separately. Or perhaps it just doesn't have sufficient power to handle the dusty tomes.

>wave s-remover at members
We reset the device to s. There is a distinct spearmint flavor, and the members turn into a member. It is a figure of a member of the Committee to Establish an Orthodox Orthography. It is plastic, small enough to sit on our palm, and wears the stiff clothing and conservative hairstyle of about 1895. It looks slightly cross, as though the member has guessed its work would take another 15 years to complete.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the member is a faint, greenish image of some members.

You have a fleeting thought of how we got here.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
>wave y-remover at army
We reset the device to y. We wave the Y-remover at the army and produce an arm, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

>gonear drinks club
Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some gimlets and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

The bartender is in the middle of showing her homonym paddle to a patron holding a gin and tonic. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves.

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

>autoupgrade
"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

>wave p-remover at patron
We reset the device to p. The letter-remover finds no p in Mark.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

>wave m-remover at patron
We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of newly sawn planks, Mark turns into an ark. From here, the width of the bow in cubits is hard to guess. It just looks huge, much too huge for the little space it's crammed into…

Unfortunately, the ark is more than sufficient to bury us under its bulk.

That is, that's what would have happened if we had done something so foolish. Shall we suppose we didn't? >>

>say hello
We already have the attention of the bartender, not to mention the curiosity of Mark.

>g
We already have the attention of the bartender, not to mention the curiosity of Mark.

>ask about paddle
"Tell me about that paddle," we say.

"This item," says the bartender, flourishing it for you to see, "is a genuine licensed homonym paddle. Changes one item into another item as long as the two have identical names."

>say hello to mark
We already have the attention of the bartender, not to mention the curiosity of Mark.

>ask mark about mark
We give Mark a look to say his input would be welcome as well.

/The bartender (doesn't seem interested in talking|doesn't have anything to say) about Mark at the moment.

>ask mark about the paddle
We give Mark a look to say his input would be welcome as well.

"Tell me about that paddle," we say.

The bartender explains again the concept of a homonym paddle that is able to convert an item into another item of the same name.

>gonear parker
Counterfeit Monkey
It takes a minute for us to adjust to the light in here. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

"Help you?" asks Parker the barman unenthusiastically.

/((I'm inclined|We want|I'd like) to|We could) ask whether he has seen Slango.

>ask parker about slango
"I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine," we say to Parker. "Name of Slango."

Parker looks over the bar at us. "He comes in here from time to time," he says. "Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes."

This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.

/We (want to|could) challenge Parker about the rum.

>ask men about slango
They're... busy. At best interrupting them would interrupt their code, and at worst it would make them think we are a Bureau agent.

/(We (want to|could)|I'd like to) challenge Parker about the rum.

>gonear arbot
(Arbot Maps & Antiques)
Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well.

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles.

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate.

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

>purloin the customer

/(Time passes|We kill some time (comparing ourselves to the mannequin|admiring the merchandise|staring idly into space|gazing out the shop window)).

The papas look rather awkward, and clamber out of our ineffective hold onto solid ground.

>ask about maps

/(Kate doesn't have anything to say in response|This evokes no particular interest).

The customer looks rather awkward, and clambers out of our ineffective hold onto solid ground.

>say hello to customer

>gonear High Street

>car-acquire
High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. 

The curb is lined with garbage. 

Our car — a sub-sub-compact that looks like it might be outraced by a kid on a scooter — is parked nearby. Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area — your hostel should be up that way — while a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.

>unprotest
>put remover in backpack
We put the P-remover into the backpack.

>close backpack
We close the backpack.

>cross traffic
You may have the nerve, but I don't.

>ignore traffic
You may have the nerve, but I don't.

>drive to roundabout
We open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.

We get into the car.

We switch on the ignition and the car comes to life. Smelly, trembling, putt-putting life, but still, not bad for something we conjured out of a vegetable picked outside my parents' place.

Roundabout (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which we can never see clearly.

Confusing signs point in various directions: northeast to Deep Street, northwest to High Street, south to Long Street, east to Tall Street.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

/(Please don't try to change lanes|They're honking at us for a reason, you know).

>park
We couldn't possibly park here.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

>get out of car

>go to deep street

Deep Street (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

This road descends steeply from southwest to northwest, passing between white concrete buildings to provide access to the marina — the Fish Market, the Docks, and a bar or two. The street is in deep shadow, protected from sunlight from almost any angle by its narrowness and by the height of the walls.

The Aquarium Bookstore is to the east. It is an esoteric bookstore (and purveyor of other things), but one whose owner has helped you in the past.

We can go northwest, southwest to the Roundabout, east, and west from here.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

>nw
Since there's no way by road, we'll have to leave the car here. It is a moment's work to find a parking spot. We switch the ignition off.

We swing the car door open.

We climb out of the car.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us. 

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen. 

>e
While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor. 

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

We catch our breath and look over our belongings to see if anything suspicious is showing. The monocle might be a little too conspicuous.

>climb masses
We identify the sturdiest-looking part of the construction and clamber onto it.

>look through window
We put an eye to one of the windows. The Authenticator is still in sight. Two assistants are in the middle of arresting a man for selling germ-based gems, but she is ignoring this play and looking for something or someone else.

>out
We get off the tarpaulin-covered masses.


>out
I don't think we want to show off the monocle around the Authenticator.

> put monocle in backpack
We open the backpack.

We gently remove the monocle.

We put the monocle into the backpack.

More racket comes in through the windows.

>out
I don't think we want to show off the P-remover and the monocle around the Authenticator.

> close backpack
We close the backpack.

>out
I don't think there's anything showing that should get us into trouble. Timidly we open the door; the Authenticator has her back to us. We slip out. She makes one more turn in place — monocled gaze sliding across us without stopping — and then she strides away to the north.

The street is in deep shadow, protected from sunlight from almost any angle by its narrowness and by the height of the walls.

The Aquarium Bookstore is to the east. It's dim inside, but occasional movements suggest that the proprietor, Slango's friend Lena, is inside.

/(We|It's a (brief|short)) drive up the steep switchback of Deep Street and through the perilous traffic of the roundabout. 

Tall Street (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield. The motor is growling like a housecat with pneumonia.

Tall Street is very quiet. No celebrations have reached this far, and neither is there any business today; so it has an air of dull abandonment. At the east end the street bends to go around an old park rarely visited.

To the south is the important blue rotunda of the Bureau of Orthography. The street runs west towards the busy roundabout.

The car is making an unpleasant raspy growl.

Counterfeit Monkey
Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

The clientele are currently engaged in a game of darts, while the barman watches and practices a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves. There is also a quantity of Origin Paste sitting out on the bar. 

Parker acknowledges our return with a nod.

I'd like to ask whether we can have the Origin Paste.

Crawlspace
An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about.

The trap door, wedged open by nothing, admits the only light.

The only significant thing down here is a crate. 

The trap-door makes a creaking noise and slams shut again. I DO NOT LIKE being in the dark in a confined space with potential rats. Sorry, I'm getting us out of here. You can come back later.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now seven.]

>prop door with stick
(first taking the stick)
We prop the trap door open with the stick.

>d

Crawlspace
An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about.

The trap door, wedged open by a stick, admits the only light.

The only significant thing down here is a crate. 

>wave t-remover at stick
The stick gives way to the now-familiar sick.

The trap-door makes a creaking noise and slams shut again. I DO NOT LIKE being in the dark in a confined space with potential rats. Sorry, I'm getting us out of here. You can come back later.

We open the trap door.

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor. 

We can also see some sick here.

[Purloined.]

>wear hairstick
We pull off the wig and smoothe down our hair.

>wear ben wig
We pull off the hairstick and smoothe down our hair.

We settle the Ben wig on our head and adjust our hair underneath.

>purloin britishizing goggles
[Purloined.]

>wear britishizing goggles
We put on the Britishising goggles. An experimental prototype that (from the perspective of the viewer only) adds -u- into words ending in -or, and reverses -er into -re wherever possible. Subjects wearing the Britishising goggles generally began to develop implausible accents and to have better than usual success wooing American tourists. Otherwise, the goggles are not much use: like my monocle, they don't affect the actual form of an object in any way.

The surplus stock were mostly given away as rewards to supporters of public television, and the Bureau discouraged even recreational use in the 1980s as they began to make progress towards greater linguistic purity.

>wear monocle
We gently remove the Britishizing goggles.

Everything turns computer-monitor green when viewed through our right eye. And staring fixedly at anything will turn up its authenticity status.

>purloin swatch
[Purloined.]

>blindfold me with swatch
We gently remove the monocle.

We pull off the Ben wig and smoothe down our hair.

We tie the swatch over our eyes. To be honest, it only partially obscures our vision; we still have a pretty good idea where everything is.

>wear monocle
We take off the swatch.

Everything turns computer-monitor green when viewed through our right eye. And staring fixedly at anything will turn up its authenticity status.

>gonear Winding Footpath
Winding Footpath
The footpath winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and bushes left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby.

>x path
There are traces of sand on the pathway, tracked up from the beach.

The monocle pings happily as we sight the footpath with the crosshairs.

>gonear Outdoor Cafe
Outdoor Café
From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

We want to say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

>jump
I don't think that would help.

My response would be to say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

>dive
(in the spill)
The spill isn't exactly deep enough to bathe in.

Nexami stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent — we don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons — but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up.

He heads into the interior of the café.

>jump into the spill

The spill isn't exactly deep enough to dive into.

>gonear Private Beach
Private Beach
This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

>jump
I don't think that would help.

Considering the delicacy of our possessions and the distance we need to travel, swimming is not a viable solution.

>gonear Precarious Perch
Precarious Perch
From up here there's a handsome distant sea, which isn't so far down really. But it's a scramble down a nearly sheer cliff for the first bit, until we make it down to the rockfall below, and it would be easy for a careless person to injure herself.

It's hard to see through the tall window to the room behind: mostly it reflects the sea.

>dive

We'd never make it from here.

>jump
You give a sudden, mad spring before I can clamp down on the impulse, and then we are in mid-air and I can see the boulders below and time seems to be going very slowly

until it isn't.

That is, that's what would have happened if we had done something so foolish. Shall we suppose we didn't? >>

>gonear Tools Exhibit
Tools and Techniques Exhibit
This area, though technically part of the Bureau, is open to the public as a display of the tools (past and present) of orthographical dominance. Everything is, alas, behind glass. Over at one end of the room is a Regency version of your own letter-remover — known as the Model T, because that is all it was originally able to remove.

Next to that there is an anagramming gun and an Etymological Reversing Chamber.

We are equipped with the following essentials: a backpack, a flash drive, a monocle, some Origin Paste, some plans, your R-remover, and a tube.

We are also carrying an apple, a card, a stick, a tomcat, and a twig.

The flash drive and the monocle are in the backpack, which is closed for greater concealment. 

>get all from tube
We squeeze vigorously, but nothing comes out.

>put all in tube
The tube's opening is too small.

>put all in paste
/That would only make a mess. Try rubbing some paste on (things|stuff) instead.

>wave e-remover at tube
/We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be an E-remover. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the tube turns into a tub. Now a handsome, giant\-sized tub with RESTORATION GEL prominently emblazoned on the front.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

>get gel
We better leave the restoration gel in there until we have decided what to put it on.

>get gel from tub

>get all from tub

>wave l-remover at plans
/We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an L-remover. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the plans turn into some pans. A set of flat skillets in cast iron: extremely bulky and heavy.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the floor with a dramatic crash.

>wave s-remover at pans
/We reset the device to s. There is a [a-z  \-]+, and the pans turn into a pan. An omelet-sized skillet in cast iron.

>wave d-remover at card
We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the floor.

>get all from chamber
No. Sorry, I just don't see how it could possibly work without our getting caught. The casing material would stop a bullet.

>purloin origin paste
[Purloined.]

>gel pan
First, we try to retrieve everything important from the pan. We take the D-remover and the tub.

We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the pan. With an audible SPLORT, the pan becomes some plans. 

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course.

>gonear rotunda
(the Rotunda)
Rotunda
Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like skylight many meters above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance.

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the entire text of A New Orthodox Orthography, which means that if we had a great deal of patience and many rolls of butcher paper, we could take rubbings and wind up with our very own volume.

We don't, of course. There are better things to do. More important places to go. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public.

/Near the street entrance is a sizable informational bulletin-board advertising the services of the Bureau; and next to this, pushed back to be out of the way, is a bin. (There is a shuttle in the bin|In the bin is a shuttle).

They're just a set of prints from the main computer design, of course, but still extremely informative: to the right engineer, they might reveal the secret of T\-insertion for replication by other companies. These are what you and Brock were originally contracted to lift from the island, at a fee in the multiple millions.

We try hiding the plans in the backpack before approaching the secretary ahead, but they are too long to fit. We decide to stay where we are for now.

Sigil Street
The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Passing by the reflective window we catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.

>e

Ampersand Bend
A bend in the street, which runs west and north. This district combines the old and the new: a small museum in an ancient stone building to the east, a shiny real estate office south. The window of the museum is currently displaying one of its exhibits, a codex.

A temporary barrier blocks this empty street from the busy fair to the north, though there is a door that could be opened with the correct code. From here the gaiety and excitement of the holiday are fairly loud.

Screening Room
Whatever is scheduled for later showing has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate, the screen is blank and no audience has yet assembled.

My backpack is stowed under a seat in the third row from the back. I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.  

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt.


"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

Nothing like that has happened around here, but she seems to get a charge out of scaring herself with this story.

We want to ask for privacy.

Cathedral Gift Shop
This area used to be a sort of antechamber where the priests and choir might gather for processions into the church, but it has now been done over for retail purposes. This is one of several schemes to make the New Church pay for its own upkeep: a problem is that people somehow feel everything associated with a church ought to be free, including lunchtime concerts, potluck suppers, and Thursday-night lecture series.

The elderly man in charge of the gift shop nods at us as we come in.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture. 

>x school
It's where I went to school until I was twelve, as did most of the kids in this area.

From this direction there's not much to see but the screen of palm trees in front.

We slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

Winding Footpath
The footpath winds between the villas, sloping steeply downward. It is narrow, and bushes left and right conceal it even from the windows of the people living nearby.

The kudu looks at us cleverly for a moment and then bounds away.

>look behind bushes
Hunting behind the bushes reveals something I vaguely remember seeing when I was a child, but not noticing again since: built into the wall is what looks like a very ancient sort of shrine.

>put god in shrine
We stand the god up in the niche in a place of solemn honor. It fits perfectly, as though shaped for just this use.

For a moment, with the air still and hot, and no one visible in any direction, we might almost believe that the past two millennia have been nothing, and that the shrine is fresh and new.

But Anglophone Atlantis prefers to forget what it was.

Achievement accomplished: Jocasta Higgate award for reconstructing pagan worship on the island!

We continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach.

Private Beach
This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

Something green and plastic just barely pokes out of the sand.

Aquarium Bookstore
The shop takes its name from the collection of fish mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recognize. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient.

The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes. You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half.

Lena is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant we come into the shop. Lena is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this.

Deep Street
This road descends steeply from southwest to northwest, passing between white concrete buildings to provide access to the marina — the Fish Market, the Docks, and a bar or two. The street is in deep shadow, protected from sunlight from almost any angle by its narrowness and by the height of the walls.

The Aquarium Bookstore is to the east. It is an esoteric bookstore (and purveyor of other things), but one whose owner has helped you in the past.

We can go northwest, southwest, east to the Aquarium Bookstore, and west from here.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us. 

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen. 

>e
While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor. 

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

We catch our breath and look over our belongings to see if anything suspicious is showing. The P-remover, the monocle, and the plans might be a little too conspicuous.

The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

The reflective window of the closed shops reflect our synthesized self.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.
